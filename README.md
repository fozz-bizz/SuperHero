# Requirements

### Objective:
  ● Create an app that lets users find out which superhero or villain they resemble from either the Marvel or DC universe, based on their answers to a personality quiz.
### Features:
  ● Personality quiz interface with a set of questions.
    ○ Minimum of 3 questions.
  ● Integration with the "SuperHero API" to fetch superhero data based on quiz results.
    ○ Determine a match from a subset of at least 3 SuperHeroes.
      ■ In other words, you don’t need to be able to match with all the heroes or villains in the API. Pick at least 3, and make a quiz that matches the user toone of your selected SuperHeroes.
  ● Display detailed profiles of matched superheroes or villains.
### Additional Requirements
  ● Implementation of at least 1 transition or animation using one of the following libraries:
    ○ React Transition Group
    ○ Framer Motion
    ○ React Spring
    ○ GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)
    ○ Styled Components (with Keyframes)
    ○ Material UI
  ● Suggestions
    ○ Animated Selection of Answers
      ■ After the user selects an answer, animate their selection with an animation on the border or background of their selected answer.
    ○ Animation of Question Cards
      ■ After the user finishes a question, animate the card that holds the question such that it moves off the screen to reveal the next question.
    ○ These are just suggestions. You may make another animation or transition.
### APIs to Use:
  ● SuperHero API (provides access to Marvel and DC characters).
### Skills Tested:
  ● API integration, State management, User interface design

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
